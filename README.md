<h1>Sales Objection Handler Console Application</h1>
<p>
  This Java console application leverages the ChatGPT API to help salespeople handle objections they encounter while selling products. By providing the name of the product, a detailed description, and the specific objection, the application sends a request to the ChatGPT API. The API then responds with a three-stage technique to address the objection, including Empathization, Clarification, and Argumentation.
